It is well understood that fatigue hinders athletic performance. Past work has studied fatigue and its effect on the upper body during shooting in basketball. However, little work has been done to analyze the impact of fatigue on the lower extremities during this activity. Using ECG, EMG, accelerometer, and PZT respiration data, we attempted to determine whether such an impact exists. With this data, we were able to identify muscle imbalances and found that better shooters had more balance, consistent leg muscle activation, and consistent vertical acceleration during shots. Though our experimental process did not seem to induce fatigue as intended, our findings offer avenues for future iterations of research in the lower extremities for basketball shooting.
